\begin{abstract}
	\noindent As a senior design project, a group of Auburn University students proposed a solution to drowning tragedies that occur frequently. One will find the motivation behind the team's project and how a solution was implemented. The students decided to first focus on a simple alarm system that could be implemented by the end of the semester, and if time permitted, focus on an alarm system that would become more useful by offering more live-saving attributes, rather than just signaling a distress call.
