\section{Project Motivation}

Drowning is often referred to as ``The Silent Death'' because there is often no cry for help or excessive splashing. With over 10 million residential swimming pools in the United States alone, it comes as no surprise that drowning is the leading cause of death for children under the age of 5 \cite{drowning}. For every child that dies from drowning, an additional 5 children are treated each year for submersion accidents, many suffering permanent neurological damage \cite{unintentional drowning}. Unfortunately, the horrors do not end there. Drowning is the most common source of death or injury for people suffering from seizures \cite{unintentional drowning}. In addition, approximately 5,000 family pets are lost each year due to drowning \cite{pets}.
