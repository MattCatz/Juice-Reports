\section{Phase 1}
The final project will be split into two phases. Phase 1 will be implementing a simple motion detection device. Phase 2 will be the device implemented in Phase 1, but better. Due to time constraints, our team wanted to choose a feasible task that could be completed by the end of the semester. Once our team completes Phase 1, and time isn't scarce, we can challenge ourselves by beginning Phase 2. Continuing with Phase 1 , there are measures that can be taken to prevent drowning tragedies. Constant supervision is, of course, the best option, but it never hurts to have backup measures in place. That’s where \juicy comes in. \juicy is a little peace of mind that floats in your pool. With its durable outer shell and solar-powered battery, \juicy can be dropped in your pool and forgotten. Unlike other similar products that only emit an alarm from the device itself or from a home base located somewhere nearby, \juicy sends a notification directly to your phone. This simple but ingenious feature makes \juicy ultra-portable, able to go from your pool to a friend’s at a moment’s notice. All you need is a WiFi connection.
